      "Data Processing Using Arrays Using NumPy arrays enables you to express many kinds of data processing tasks as concise array expressions that might otherwise require writing loops. This practice of replacing explicit loops with array expressions is commonly referred to as vectoriza- tion. In general, vectorized array operations will often be one or two (or more) orders of magnitude faster than their pure Python equivalents, with the biggest impact in any kind of numerical computations. Later, in\n",

The key to making it fast is to use vectorized operations, generally implemented through Num‐ Py’s universal functions (ufuncs). This section motivates the need for NumPy’s ufuncs, which can be used to make repeated calculations on array elements much more effi‐ cient. It then introduces many of the most common and useful arithmetic ufuncs available in the NumPy package.\n",

For numerical data, NumPy arrays are a much more efficient way of storing and manipulating data than the other built-in Python data structures. Also, libraries written in a lower-level language, such as C or Fortran, can operate on the data stored in a NumPy array without copying any data.\n",
